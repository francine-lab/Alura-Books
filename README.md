# Alura Books Project

The job was to create an array with movies or books where users could choose one to be printed on the screen. 

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Choose a book title to see the cover on the screen.

## Extra task

- I implemented a merge method in which users could see a list of books organized in different lines, and they choose one book telling only the title number. I also validated the input by informing users when a number was not an option :D
